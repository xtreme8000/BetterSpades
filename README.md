## ![](docs/icon_small.png) BetterSpades

* Replicate of the great game *Ace of Spades* (classic voxlap)
* runs on very old systems back to OpenGL 1.1 (OpenGL ES support too)
* shares similar if not even better performance to voxlap
* can run on *"embedded"* systems like a [Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/353380/Steam_Link/)

#### Why should I use this instead of ...?

* free of any Jagex code, they can't shut it down
* open for future expansion
* easy to use
* no hidden bugs

### Quick usage guide

**As of right now, you can download the newest stable version from the [releases page](https://github.com/xtreme8000/BetterSpades/releases).**

**You can get [nightly builds here](http://bytebit.info.tm/jenkins/job/BetterSpades/).**

You can either:
* use the client temporarily by extracting the downloaded zip into a new directory.
* extract all contents to your current Ace of Spades installation directory (normally found at `C:/Ace of Spades/`), effectively replacing the old voxlap version

You will need to compile the following by yourself, or get hold of precompiled binaries:

* GLFW3
* GLEW
* OpenAL soft *(only needed on Windows)*
* libdeflate
* enet

Follow the instructions on their project page, then place produced static libraries in `libs/`.

Some files need to be copied to the `src/` directory.

This means:

| source                        | &rightarrow; | destination                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dr_wav.h`                    | &rightarrow; | `src/dr_wav.c` <br /> Make sure to add `#define DR_WAV_IMPLEMENTATION` on the first line |
| `lodepng.h` and `lodepng.cpp` | &rightarrow; | `src/lodepng/lodepng.h` and `src/lodepng/lodepng.c`                                      |
| `libdeflate.h`                | &rightarrow; | `src/libdeflate.h`                                                                       |
| `ini.c` and `ini.h`           | &rightarrow; | `src/ini.c` and `src/ini.h`                                                              |
| `parson.c` and `parson.h`     | &rightarrow; | `src/parson.c` and `src/parson.h`                                                        |
| `http.h`                      | &rightarrow; | `src/http.h`                                                                             |
| `stb_truetype.h`              | &rightarrow; | `src/stb_truetype.h`                                                                     |
| `log.h` and `log.c`           | &rightarrow; | `src/log.h` and `src/log.c`                                                              |


Because state of copyright of 0.75 assets is unknown, you will need to get them *[here](http://aos.party/bsresources.zip)*. Unzip the file and extract all contents to `resources/` manually.

#### Windows

This project uses CMake to generate all Makefiles automatically. It's best to use MinGW for GCC on Windows. You can generate the required files by opening `cmd.exe` in the `build/` directory and typing:
```
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
make
```
You might need to replace `make` by `mingw32-make` if cmd tells you it could not find the first.

If everything went well, the client should be in the `build/bin/` subfolder.

When starting `client.exe`, you will be greeted by a server list. Select a server on it to start playing!
You can also start the client the same way as you did with the voxlap version by opening cmd and putting an `aos://` link in as the first argument:

```
client.exe -aos://16777343:32887 //Connects to a local server
```

#### Linux

Compilation now works the same on Linux. Just change the build system to `Unix Makefiles` or leaving it as default will probably work too (`cmake ..`).

You can build each library yourself, or install them with your distro's package manager:
```
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa libgl1-mesa-dev libopenal1 libopenal-dev libglfw-dev libenet-dev libglew-dev
```
(this does not include libdeflate or lodepng which are a requirement too, see [_Wiki/Building_](https://github.com/xtreme8000/BetterSpades/wiki/Building) for more details)

Start the client e.g. with the following inside the `build/bin/` directory:
```
./client -aos://16777343:32887
```

#### macOS

The same instructions for Linux work on macOS aside from some minor differences. First, use Homebrew or MacPorts to grab dependencies:
```
brew install glfw enet
```
The development headers for OpenAL and OpenGL don't have to be installed since they come with macOS by default. libdeflate and lodepng should be installed and placed manually in a way similar to Linux. See [_Wiki/Building_](https://github.com/xtreme8000/BetterSpades/wiki/Building) for more details.
